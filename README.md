# Predicting Data Breach Severity on Publically Reported Breaches

This is a Machine Learning project that aims to predict the number of records from a data breach based on properties of the data breach. 

The data is used from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (non-public dataset) and can be found here http://privacyrights.org/data-breaches. 

To reproduce this project, or use any of the ML pipelines or figures in it, you will need to install the packages outlined in the breach.yml file. 

Jupyter notebooks are found in /src, figures in /figures, models and predictions in /results, and a paper in /reports.
